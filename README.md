# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
# Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform customer segmentation using the K-Means Clustering algorithm. By analyzing customer data, we can identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behavior, which helps businesses target specific segments with tailored marketing strategies.

# Project Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer patterns.

Apply K-Means Clustering to segment customers into distinct groups.

Visualize the clusters for better interpretation and insights.
Technologies Used
Language: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

# How It Works
1. Data Loading & Preprocessing

   Import customer data.

   Handle missing values and outliers.

   Scale and prepare data for clustering.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

   Visualize key features.

   Understand distributions and relationships.

3. K-Means Clustering

   Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.

   Train the K-Means model.

   Predict cluster assignments.

4. Visualization

   Plot customer segments in 2D/3D.

   Analyze and interpret cluster characteristics.

# Results
The final output groups customers into meaningful segments that can be used for targeted marketing, personalized offers, and improved customer service.
